# TodoList_React_Django
A Task Manager application was created in React on the client side and Django Rest Framework on the server-side. So React serves as the front-end, handling UI through the requests to Django's backend.

The prerequisites for this project are :
1- Python
2- Node.js 
Install dependencies in the package.json file.

To run:
1- Open in VScode
2- cd backend, in the terminal run the command "python manage.py runserver". Then go to Chrome and type the "http://localhost:8000/api/tasks/" command for the database.
3- cd frontend, run the command "npm start" in the terminal. 
4- A perfectly working todo app opens where you can add new tasks with descriptions, mark them as completed or not, and edit and delete them.
