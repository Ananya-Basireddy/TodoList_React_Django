# TodoList_React_Django
A Task Manager application was created in React on the client side and Django Rest Framework on the server-side. So React serves as the front-end, handling UI through the requests to Django's backend.

#The prerequisites for this project are :
* Python
* Node.js 

Install dependencies in the package.json file.

#To run:
*Open in VScode
* cd backend, in the terminal run the command 
```python manage.py runserver```
 Then go to Chrome and type the "http://localhost:8000/api/tasks/" command for the database.
* cd frontend, run this command in the terminal. 
 ```npm start```
* A perfectly working todo app opens where you can add new tasks with descriptions, mark them as completed or not, and edit and delete them.
